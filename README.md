# Dev Logs and Blogs

**Disclaimer:**  
Not all logs and blogs are meant to spark *awesomeness*. I used the word `awesome` because GitHub seems to have a naming convention of *awesome* when it comes to curated lists. Some blogs are very introspective and I don't mean to disrespect in any way by including them in this list.

This project was created to curate logs (even games), blogs (mostly from dev blogs), etc. The complete development process can be found on the [documentation](https://github.com/EledenGreen/awesome-dev-logs-and-blogs/blob/main/documentation.md) page.

Share any logs or blogs that you find interesting by making a PR.
